##  For Educators

This site is designed to teach critical thinking, not provide answers. It's appropriate for:

- High school civic classes
- College-level media literacy
- Adult education programs
- Parent-teacher meetings
- Independent study
- Homeschooling curriculum

## For Parents

Share the URL with your kids. Encourage them to:
- Verify claims using the provided sources
- Disagree with sections they find unconvincing
- Apply the concepts to media they consume daily
- Develop their own informed opinions

## For Developers

The site is intentionally simple:
- Single HTML file (no build process)
- Vanilla CSS (no frameworks)
- No JavaScript required
- View source to learn the structure
- Fork and improve

## Verification

Every claim is documented. To verify any section:

1. Read the claim on this site
2. Find the corresponding source in the "Sources" section
3. Consult the original source directly
4. Decide for yourself

This is how actual intellectual independence works.

## License

This content is provided freely. You may:
- Host it on your own site
- Modify it for your needs
- Share it widely
- Use it in educational settings
- Critique and improve it

The only request: keep it accessible and encourage people to verify claims themselves.

## Feedback

This is a work in progress. If you find:
- Sources that should be updated
- Claims that need verification
- Sections that could be clearer
- Opportunities for improvement

Consider how you'd improve it for your audience.

## Why This Exists

Most education systems don't teach how to recognize manipulation. Most institutions don't want you understanding how they actually work. This site exists to fill that gap—not with opinions, but with documented mechanisms and practical tools for independent thinking.

Your children (and you) deserve better than unconscious manipulation.
